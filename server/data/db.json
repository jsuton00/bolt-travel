However, after the very long process of designing the name, we came up with the name Bolt Travel.</p><p>The name Bolt Travel has two meanings. The first meaning of the name can be understood through the image of a thunderbolt which describes the online business of Bolt Travel as a fast, secure and reliable online booking platform that will help book your perfect holiday in just a few clicks.</p><p>The second meaning of the name, what is very interesting, is that the name Bolt is actually an acronym which in detail describes our business.</p>",

				"text": "<h2>A City with the Twist of Ancient and Modern All in One Place</h2><p>Visit Split, the largest city in Dalmatia and the second largest city in Croatia.</p><p>This vibrant and crazy city is the perfect place for travellers of different ages, tastes and interests. Located in a unique setting, Split offers the right balance of everything to do and more, including visiting ancient and historical attractions such as Diocletian’s Palace, Cathedral of St. Domnius, Peristyle and the Substructures of the Diocletian’s Palace); sitting at one of the dozens bars and restaurants available in the old town centre; on Riva or the Western bank; do some sport activities on the Marjan Hill while looking at the gorgeous panoramic view of Split; spending some time on the most popular beaches such as Bacvice or Kastelet and enjoying the busy nightlife in Split from listening to live music on the open-air to bopping to the rhythm and beat of the most popular disco and night clubs in city.</p><p>All of these in Split, travellers can accomplish in a day or two. Because the city is well connected by land or sea, Split represents an ideal spot for travellers to stay longer and plan their trips to various destinations such as the towns of Trogir, Makarska, Omis and Dubrovnik, islands of Brac, Solta, Hvar, Korcula and Vis, and national parks Plitvice, Krka and Kornati.</p><p>Before hopping over to discover other destinations, let's explore together the city of Split.</p><h2>About Split</h2><h3>Brief History</h3><p>Although the beginnings of Split are traditionally associated with the construction of Diocletian's Palace in 305 AD, the city was founded several centuries earlier as the Greek colony of Aspálathos, or Spálathos in the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> century BC. After the Greeks, the entire area became under the Roman rule when between 295 and 305 AD the Roman Emperor Diocletian built his magnificent palace from which Split has developed.</p><p>After the Roman Empire fell, Split has gone through a turbulent history of moving between different kingdoms and countries. Split experienced the Croatian then later the Hungary-Croatian Kingdom, the Venetian Republic, the French Empire the Austrian-Hungary Empire, Yugoslavia and ending in modern Croatia. Their influence on Split can be found in the city’s architecture, gastronomy, culture and customs which all together make the city so unique.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>Split is positioned on the Adriatic coast, in central Dalmatia. The old town is situated on a peninsula between the eastern part of the Gulf of Kastela and the Split Channel. Split is surrounded by the mountains inland (e.g. Mosor, Kozjak and Marjan Hill) and by the islands of Brač, Šolta, Hvar and Čiovo.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p>Thanks to the Mediterranean climate, winters are mild in Split, lasting from December to March, although the actual experience of winter can really be felt only in February. For this reason, all the comforts of Split can be savoured for most of the winter, from sightseeing the Diocletian’s Palace to the tastings of all the delicacies in numerous restaurants and at the Christmas fair on the Riva during the Christmas holidays. It is quite frequent to spend sunny winter mornings sitting at cafes.</p><p>Spring in Split lasts from March to June, and it is one of the best seasons for visiting Split. The average temperature is the ideal 20°C, abundant in sunny periods perfect for walking on Marjan, excursions, and even swimming in the late spring. During this season Split begins bursting with life and it is the ideal period for walking through the streets and city squares.</p><p>Although the high temperatures characterize summers in Split, sometimes even over 35°C, starting from June and to mid-September, you can find refreshment in the beautiful Adriatic sea at many of Split's beaches or on the nearby islands. During the summer nights, you can unwind through different events, such as the Days of Diocletian, Split Summer Festival and many others, where everyone can find something for themselves, and where you can experience the true Mediterranean hustle and bustle.</p><p>Autumn in Split lasts from the end of September to December. Although not a favourite part of the year to some, in many ways it is the most beautiful time of the year to visit Split. It is the time when the temperature of the sea is ideal for swimming, the summer heat is at its low and the main season is still on.</p><h2>Top Sights in Split</h2><p><strong>Diocletian’s Palace </strong>- This huge, fortress-like palace served as a residence for a Roman emperor &amp; the military garrison. </p><p><strong>Cathedral of Saint Domnius</strong> - Historic 4<sup>th</sup>-century Catholic church. Built-in 305 AD, this cathedral dedicated to the city's patron saint has a Romanesque bell tower. It is the oldest cathedral in the world. </p><p><strong>Peristyle</strong> – The central square of Diocletian’s Palace which is surrounded by the Cathedral of Saint Domnius, Vestibule and the Substructures</p><p><strong>Diocletian's Cellars</strong> – One of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world. They can be accessed from Riva through the Brass Gate or climbing downstairs from Peristyle. In the past, they were used as a storage facility, a residential area and for producing wine and pressing olives. Today, they are usually used as a place for organising different manifestations, selling unique valuable souvenirs and sightseeing. </p><p><strong>Riva (The Promenade)</strong> – The most popular and most important public place in Split. Thrusting with cafes and restaurants, it is an ideal place for having your morning or afternoon coffee or for an evening out with friends over drinks. There are also numerous cultural and entertainment events being held throughout the year.</p><p><strong>Pjaca (People’s Square – Narodni Trg)</strong> – The main square in Split. Located outside of the Diocletian’s Palace, it is filled with many historical attractions (e.g. Old Town Hall, Palace Ciprianis and the old Clock Bell Tower) and numerous bars, restaurants and shops.</p>",

			"content": {
				"text": "<h2>Feel like a royal in the town of King Arthur and the Elite Suburb of Split</h2><p>Podstrana is a coastal town located just 8 kilometres from the city of Split. It consists of five villages: Gornja Podstrana which is the oldest village located on the slopes of the Perun Hill and four villages Strožanac, Grljevac, St. Martin and Mutogras which are located along the coast.</p><p>Because of its perfect location, beautiful natural surroundings, stunning beaches and an abundance of restaurants, bars, hotels and other amenities, Podstrana is considered an attractive tourist destination, one of the most elite suburbs in Split and it is usually compared with the city of Santa Monica in California, USA.</p><h2>About Podstrana</h2><h3>The Legend of King Arthur</h3><p>Have you ever heard about the legendary King Arthur? I am sure you have. However, did you know that Podstrana is linked with the famous King Arthur? Near the church of St. Martin, there is a sarcophagus and an inscribed gravestone of Lucius Artorius Castus, a Roman soldier which is considered to be the famous King Arthur, according to modern historical theories.</p><p>According to archaeological findings and historical resources, Lucius Artorius Castus lived between the 2nd and 3rd century AD. He was a centurion who served in many legions throughout his extensive military career. Lucius served in Syria and Judea as well as in the provinces of Dacia and Apennine Peninsula in what is today Romania and Italy. Near the end of his career, he was transferred to Britannia where he was in charge of two Roman legions based in modern-day York, England. After his rewarding military career had finished, he decided to retire and live in the area of nowadays Podstrana, where it is believed that he and his family had originated from.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>Podstrana is situated at the foot of Perun, the slope of the mountain Mosor. It is located just 7 kilometres from the city of Split and 15 km from Omiš. It consists of five villages: Gornja Podstrana which is the oldest village located on the slopes of the Perun Hill and four villages Strožanac, Grljevac, St. Martin and Mutogras which are located along the coast.<p><h3>Beaches</h3><p>Along the beautiful coast, Podstrana is rich with plenty of beautiful beaches. All beaches are covered with small pebbles and provide easy access to the sea. On the beaches, you may find many bars and restaurants where you can relax and have a meal while spending some time at the sea. You can also try different water activities such as swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving, rowing, sailing and windsurfing.</p><h3>Restaurants</h3><p>As a tourist destination, Podstrana provides a good choice of restaurants and local tavern which serve excellent local Croatian, Dalmatian and Mediterranean cuisines. The most popular restaurants in Podstrana are considered to be Restaurant Arkada, Restaurant Amigos and Konoba Argola.</p><h3>Shopping in Podstrana</h3><p>Podstrana has a few grocery stores that are open every day where you can find a huge range of groceries. If you want to go to a larger supermarket and shopping centre then we recommend City Centre One and Mall of Split which is only 5 kilometres from Podstrana. Besides the hypermarket in the centre, there is a large selection of fashion, footwear, perfume shops and a pharmacy.</p><h3>Nightlife in Podstrana</h3><p>As a vibrant destination, Podstrana has a bustling nightlife which is especially emphasised during the summer season. During the period, the local community organises different events and festivals where local citizens and tourists can enjoy participating in activities and listening to live music. You may also visit one of the many cafes and beach bars in Podstrana which serve cocktails and play live music. If you are looking for a more wider choice, you can always visit nearby Split.</p><h2>What to Do in Podstrana</h2><p>Due to its excellent location, Podstrana is the perfect space to choose as a starting point for visiting different sights in Croatia. For frequent visits, we recommend that you visit these top sights:</p><p><strong>Split</strong> is located only 8 km from Podstrana. It is one of the best known and most visited tourist destinations in Croatia and the second largest city in the country.

Of its historical characteristics, we emphasize the following: the fortresses Mirabella and Fortica, the parish church of St. Michael, Franciscan monastery, churches of St. Peter, Holy Spirit, the Illyrian seminary, old cemetery, medieval town centre, the pole of shame and the old town lodge. Sports fans can take part in river rafting on the Cetina, free climbing, windsurfing, swimming marathon, beach volleyball and other activities.</p><p><strong>Trogir</strong> is located in the centre of Dalmatia. Its port is preferred by seafarers because of its favourable location and natural protection.
